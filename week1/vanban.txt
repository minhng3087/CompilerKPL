As he took up office, Trump immediately managed to hobble Obamacare – one of the biggest achievements of his previous, President Obama. The action made public opinion break out, and people not only in the USA but also in the world called him the cruel guy. Obamacare was an act that make health insurance available for US citizens, especially the poor, and its official name of the law is the Affordable Care Act. However, President Trump considered this act completely the opposite with one of important American values, independence, which means that the America, regardless of the rich of the poor, must be self-reliant and depends on no one to feed and finance them. As a result, he got rid of this law and was strongly censured.
Recently, President Donald Trump has grabbed the headlines of many magazines regardless inside or outside the USA for throwing a grenade triggering the commercial war between his nation and China. The press acknowledged that he is hobbling China because this nation’s economy is getting bigger and might gulp his USA down in a near future. However, it is true that this trade war is the economic sanctions after mischief and tricks China did not only with the business but also the politics of America.
